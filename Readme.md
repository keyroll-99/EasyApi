Fiona is a web api framework written in .Net. As developer you will be able to create API in easily and quacky way.
The planned key feature is a GUI where developer will be able create API using blocks like blueprint in UE.

At the begin I use HttpListener, but in the distant future I want to write own http hand shake.

The project was initiated as part of the "100 commits" competition

Repo will be rename after 100 commits competition, because I came up with the idea for the name after registering the repo.

## Is it ready on production
Nope, maybe in the future
