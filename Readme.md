Fiona is a web api framework written in .Net. As a developer, you will be able to create API easily and quickly.
The planned key feature is a GUI where a developer will be able to create API using blocks like a blueprint in UE.

In the beginning, I used HttpListener, but in the distant future, I want to write my HTTP handshake.

The project was initiated as part of the "100 commitÃ³w" competition

The Repo will be renamed after 100 commits competition because I came up with the idea for the name after registering the repo.

## Is it ready for production

Nope, maybe in the future

## How to run a simple server

in `Program.cs`

```c#
using Fiona.Hosting;
using Fiona.Hosting.Abstractions;

IFionaHostBuilder serviceBuilder = FionaHostBuilder.CreateHostBuilder();

using IFionaHost host = serviceBuilder.Build();

host.Run();
```

sample controller

```c#
using Fiona.Hosting.Controller.Attributes;
using Fiona.Hosting.Routing;
using Fiona.Hosting.Routing.Attributes;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace SampleFionaServer.Controller;

public class HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
{
    private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger = logger;
    
    [Route(HttpMethodType.Get)]
    public Task<string> Index()
    {
        _logger.Log(LogLevel.Critical, "Home Controller Index");
        return Task.FromResult("Home");
    }
}
```
