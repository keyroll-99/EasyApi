# About
Fiona is a web api framework written in .Net. As a developer, you will be able to create API easily and quickly.
The planned key feature is a GUI where a developer will be able to create API using blocks like a blueprint in UE.

In the beginning, I used HttpListener, but in the distant future, I want to write my HTTP handshake.

The project was initiated as part of the "100 commits" competition

The Repo will be renamed after 100 commits competition because I came up with the idea for the name after registering the repo.
